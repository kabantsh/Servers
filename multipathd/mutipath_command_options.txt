  multipath [-v level] [-i] [-u|-U]
  multipath [-h|-t|-T]

Where:
  -h      print this usage text
  -l      show multipath topology (sysfs and DM info)
  -ll     show multipath topology (maximum info)
  -e      enable foreign libraries with -l/-ll
  -f      flush a multipath device map
  -F      flush all multipath device maps
  -a      add a device wwid to the wwids file
  -c      check if a device should be a path in a multipath device
  -C      check if a multipath device has usable paths
  -q      allow queue_if_no_path when multipathd is not running
  -d      dry run, do not create or update devmaps
  -t      display the currently used multipathd configuration
  -T      display the multipathd configuration without builtin defaults
  -r      force devmap reload
  -i      ignore wwids file
  -B      treat the bindings file as read only
  -b fil  bindings file location
  -w      remove a device from the wwids file
  -W      reset the wwids file include only the current devices
  -R num  number of times to retry removes of in-use devices
  -u      check if the device specified in the program environment should be a
          path in a multipath device
  -U      check if the device specified in the program environment is a
          multipath device with usable paths, see -C flag
  -p pol  force all maps to specified path grouping policy:
          . failover            one path per priority group
          . multibus            all paths in one priority group
          . group_by_serial     one priority group per serial
          . group_by_prio       one priority group per priority lvl
          . group_by_node_name  one priority group per target node
  -v lvl  verbosity level:
          . 0 no output
          . 1 print created devmap names only
          . 2 default verbosity
          . 3 print debug information
  device  action limited to:
          . multipath named 'device' (ex: mpath0)
          . multipath whose wwid is 'device' (ex: 60051...)
          . multipath including the path named 'device' (ex: /dev/sda or
            /dev/dm-0)
          . multipath including the path with maj:min 'device' (ex: 8:0)
